      This is a focused course for students who have
      previously taken the PSAT exam as a sophomore but
      did not receive a desired score on the writing skills 
      portion or students who will be taking the PSAT and 
      wish to strengthen their skills in the writing skills 
      area. Outcomes of the course will be measured using 
      the original PSAT writing skills score or the course 
      pre-test compared to both the subsequent PSAT 
      writing skills score and a course post-test.
